# CAN-M Website

## Static website for CAN-M, a Montreal-based community group working on COVID-19 advocacy. 

Working on setting this up as a place to display information and links to information. Studies, articles, places to buy supplies, links to other COVID advocacy groups.

## How It's Made:

It's a vanilla JS CSS HTML static website, babyyyy!

## Optimizations

Want to figure out how to make it so team members can add/remove/update information. TBQH ideal scenario for me is they all learn how to use git + github. Probably good for them. Builds moral fibre.
